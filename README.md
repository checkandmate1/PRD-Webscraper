Little Project I've worked on to learn webscraping, and what other way to do it than to check some routes!
Thank you to the Virtual New York ARTCC (nyartcc.org) for providing their preferred route database!
You just input a departure airport, an arrival airport, and a route and it will validate it.

Note: When specifying a certain SID/ STAR, use a "#" instead of the number. A fix for this will come in the future.
